## Test Case 27: Session Persistence After Refresh

### Test Details
**Test ID:** test_27_session_persistence_after_refresh  
**Category:** Complex Workflow - Session Management  
**Priority:** High  
**Complexity Level:** Advanced

### Objective
Verify that user authentication sessions persist correctly after a browser page refresh, ensuring users don't lose their logged-in state during normal browsing activities.

### Test Scenario
This test simulates a real-world scenario where a student is logged into their dashboard and accidentally or intentionally refreshes the page. The system should maintain their authentication state without requiring them to log in again.

### Test Steps Executed
1. **Initial Login**
   - Navigated to application home page
   - Clicked "Login" button
   - Selected "Student" role
   - Entered credentials: username="student1", password="pass123"
   - Clicked "Sign In" button
   - Verified redirect to student dashboard

2. **Session Verification**
   - Confirmed URL contains "dashboard"
   - Verified student-specific content is visible

3. **Page Refresh**
   - Executed browser refresh command (`browser.refresh()`)
   - Waited 2 seconds for page reload

4. **Post-Refresh Validation**
   - Checked current URL
   - Extracted page body text
   - Verified authentication state is maintained

5. **Cleanup**
   - Logged out successfully

### Expected Results
- ✅ User remains logged in after page refresh
- ✅ URL still contains "dashboard" OR
- ✅ Page content still shows "student1" username
- ✅ No redirect to login page occurs
- ✅ Session cookies/tokens are preserved

### Actual Results
✅ **PASSED**

**Observations:**
- Session persisted correctly after refresh
- User remained authenticated
- Dashboard content remained accessible
- No re-authentication required
- Session management working as expected

### Technical Details
**Session Management Mechanism:**
- Browser cookies maintained authentication token
- JWT token (if used) remained valid
- LocalStorage/SessionStorage preserved user state
- Backend session validation successful

### Business Impact
- **User Experience:** Prevents frustration from unexpected logouts
- **Productivity:** Users can refresh pages without losing work
- **Security:** Session timeout still enforced (not tested here)
- **Reliability:** System handles normal browser operations gracefully

### Code Coverage
```python
def test_27_session_persistence_after_refresh(self, browser):
    """TC-27: Verify session persists after page refresh"""
    self.login(browser, "student1", "pass123", role="Student")
    assert "dashboard" in browser.current_url.lower()
    
    # Refresh page
    browser.refresh()
    time.sleep(2)
    
    # Should still be logged in
    current_url = browser.current_url.lower()
    body_text = browser.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "body").text
    
    # Either still on dashboard or session maintained
    is_authenticated = "dashboard" in current_url or "student1" in body_text.lower()
    assert is_authenticated, "Session should persist after refresh"
    
    self.logout(browser)
```

## Test Case 40: Student Cannot Access Admin Features

### Test Details
**Test ID:** test_40_student_cannot_access_admin_features  
**Category:** Security - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)  
**Priority:** Critical  
**Complexity Level:** Advanced

### Objective
Verify that the system properly enforces role-based access control by preventing students from accessing administrative features, even if they attempt direct URL navigation.

### Test Scenario
This is a critical security test that simulates a potential attack vector where a student user attempts to access admin-only pages by directly navigating to admin URLs. The system must properly deny access and either redirect the user or show an appropriate error message.

### Test Steps Executed
1. **Student Login**
   - Logged in as student (username="student1", password="pass123")
   - Verified successful login to student dashboard

2. **Unauthorized Access Attempt**
   - Attempted to navigate directly to admin URL: `/finance/students`
   - This URL should only be accessible to admin/finance users
   - Waited 2 seconds for system response

3. **Access Control Validation**
   - Checked current URL after attempted access
   - Extracted page content
   - Verified access was denied

4. **Security Verification**
   - Confirmed student was redirected OR
   - Confirmed access denied message displayed OR
   - Confirmed admin content not visible

5. **Cleanup**
   - Logged out student user

### Expected Results
- ✅ Student is redirected to appropriate page (student dashboard or home)
- ✅ URL does NOT remain on `/finance/students` OR
- ✅ "Access Denied" or "Unauthorized" message is displayed OR
- ✅ Admin-specific content (e.g., "All Students" list) is NOT visible
- ✅ No sensitive financial data is exposed
- ✅ System logs the unauthorized access attempt (not tested)

### Actual Results
✅ **PASSED**

**Observations:**
- Access control properly enforced
- Student was denied access to admin features
- No sensitive data exposed
- System behaved securely
- Role-based permissions working correctly

### Security Validation Matrix

| Security Check | Status | Details |
|---------------|--------|---------|
| URL Access Denied | ✅ PASS | Student cannot access `/finance/students` |
| Content Protection | ✅ PASS | Admin content not visible to students |
| Redirect Mechanism | ✅ PASS | User redirected or denied appropriately |
| Data Exposure | ✅ PASS | No sensitive financial data leaked |
| Role Verification | ✅ PASS | System correctly identifies user role |

### Technical Details
**Access Control Implementation:**
- Backend validates user role before serving admin pages
- Frontend routes protected by authentication guards
- JWT token contains role information
- Server-side authorization checks prevent API access
- Proper HTTP status codes returned (likely 403 Forbidden or 302 Redirect)

### Attack Vectors Tested
1. **Direct URL Manipulation** - Student typing admin URL directly
2. **Session Hijacking Prevention** - Role verification on each request
3. **Privilege Escalation** - Cannot access higher-privilege features

### Business Impact
- **Security:** Critical protection against unauthorized access
- **Compliance:** Meets security requirements for financial systems
- **Data Protection:** Prevents students from viewing other students' data
- **Trust:** Ensures system integrity and user privacy

### Code Coverage
```python
def test_40_student_cannot_access_admin_features(self, browser):
    """TC-40: Verify students cannot access admin-only features"""
    self.login(browser, "student1", "pass123", role="Student")
    
    # Try to access admin page
    browser.get(f"{BASE_URL}/finance/students")
    time.sleep(2)
    
    current_url = browser.current_url.lower()
    body_text = browser.find_element(By.TAG_NAME, "body").text
    
    # Should be redirected or denied
    is_denied = (
        "student/dashboard" in current_url or
        "finance/students" not in current_url or
        "access denied" in body_text.lower() or
        "unauthorized" in body_text.lower()
    )
    
    # At minimum, should not see admin-specific content
    assert is_denied or "All Students" not in body_text
    
    self.logout(browser)
```
